In this project I used R to predict the mpg of prototypes using a number of variables within the dataset.
I initially looked at mpg vs all other categories to see if there were significant variables.

summary(lm(mpg ~ vehicle.length + vehicle.weight + spoiler.angle + ground.clearance + AWD,data=MechaCar))

    Residuals:
         Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
    -19.4701  -4.4994  -0.0692   5.4433  18.5849 

    Coefficients:
                       Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
    (Intercept)      -1.040e+02  1.585e+01  -6.559 5.08e-08 ***
    vehicle.length    6.267e+00  6.553e-01   9.563 2.60e-12 ***
    vehicle.weight    1.245e-03  6.890e-04   1.807   0.0776 .  
    spoiler.angle     6.877e-02  6.653e-02   1.034   0.3069    
    ground.clearance  3.546e+00  5.412e-01   6.551 5.21e-08 ***
    AWD              -3.411e+00  2.535e+00  -1.346   0.1852    
    ---
    Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

    Residual standard error: 8.774 on 44 degrees of freedom
    Multiple R-squared:  0.7149,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6825 
    F-statistic: 22.07 on 5 and 44 DF,  p-value: 5.35e-11

The above data shows that the intercept, the vehicle length, and ground clearance have significant effects on mpg. We can see this
by the very small p values. The other variables have non-statistically significant p-values, suggesting they are random for mpg.
The R-squared value above shows a strong correlation between our variables. I also decided to run the analysis on the variables that 
had the most effect on mpg.

summary(lm(mpg ~ vehicle.length + ground.clearance ,data=MechaCar))

    Residuals:
        Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
    -17.493  -7.705   1.344   6.642  18.500 

    Coefficients:
                     Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
    (Intercept)      -91.5573    13.9649  -6.556 3.86e-08 ***
    vehicle.length     6.0811     0.6732   9.033 7.68e-12 ***
    ground.clearance   3.5669     0.5401   6.604 3.26e-08 ***
    ---
    Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

    Residual standard error: 9.078 on 47 degrees of freedom
    Multiple R-squared:  0.674,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6601 
    F-statistic: 48.59 on 2 and 47 DF,  p-value: 3.637e-12

This time all the variables I looked at are significant. The R-squared Pearson correlation is now at a moderate strength. 2 variables account 
for almost 70% of the explained variance for mpg.

Challenge questions:

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    Vehicle length, ground clearance, and the intercept

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
    No,the slopes of vehicle length and ground clearance are 6.0811 and 3.5669. I can reject the null hypothesis thats the slope is 0.
    The p-values for each were well below 0.05 meaning they are statistically significant.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
yes, in the first summary we looked at the R-squared was 0.7149 vs the second more focused summary of 0.674. This means that around 70% of the
variance is explained. An R-squared number that is too high can also be suspect (upwards of 90).


Suspension....................

In this section i created a summary statistics table for the PSI info.

summary(suspension$PSI)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
   1463    1497    1500    1500    1501    1536 

The summary function provides part of the data that we want, but it is not accurate enough. I ran several functions to get the following metrics:

Mean: 1499.531
Median: 1499.747
Variance: 76.23459
Standard Deviation: 8.731242

One of the design specifications is that the variance does not exceed 100 per inch. The data above shows that the design falls within the required 
range. The variance is 76.23459, well within the 100 pound limit. This variance means that the PSI will vary up plus or minus 76.23459 from the mean.

T-test---------------------

One Sample t-test

data:  log10(suspension$PSI)
t = -7247086, df = 149, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 3.175540 3.176356
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 3.175948 

Suspension coil pound-per-inch results are statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch. We can reject the null 
hypothesis because of the p-value < 2.2e-16. 


Future study:
I would look at a multitude of different metrics to see what the buyers are really looking for.

1) Think critically about what metrics you would think would be of interest to a consumer (cost, fuel efficiency, color options, etc.):
    I think the following items would be of interest:
        warranty - people want to know they are protected when their car breaks down
        model choice - different seating capacities and options can be more popular
        reliability - will the car break down?
        fuel efficiency - city and highway mileage efficiency may have cost savings
        price - price is almost always one of the largest factors
        options - can the consumer customize the car?
        color options - what colors sell the best
        performance - how does the car perform in different tests such as acceleration, braking, turning etc...
        emissions - environmental impact is a popular topic now. 

2) Determine what question we would ask, what the null and alternative hypothesis would be to answer that question, and what statistical test could be 
used to test this hypothesis.

     - Null hypothesis = For each metric listed above, out-performing the competitor, will have no effect on the buyer's decision to 
       purchase the MechaCar.
     - Alternative hypothesis = There is  clear statistical significance between out-performing the competition and deciding to purchase the vehicle
    - Statistical test = Chi-Squared Test to determine the frequencies between the metrics.
    - we can also conduct two sample t-tests between the mechacar and comparable cars for each metric.
    - we can use the Pearson's correlation to determine the correlations 

3) we would collect this data from surveys, consumer reports, and manufacturer reports. We can look at the competition and see what works for them.
    I believe surveying the consumer will give us a lot of insight into what the average person is looking at for their car needs.
